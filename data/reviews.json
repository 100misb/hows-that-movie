I had gone into 'Murder on the Orient Express' the same way, without knowing the story and enjoyed it that little bit more because of it. The result was the same again, I had a great time with 'Death on the Nile'.The cast isn't quite as strong this time around I have to start by saying. Mind you the cast for that film was incredible and was always going to be hard to live up to. The lack of star power didn't have to hurt the film necessarily, but I did find quite a few of the performances quite flat this time around.I found the story in this one absolutely top-notch. A lot of time is put into the set up (slightly over half the film) and yet it never feels pointless or sluggish. For a film with very little in the way of action the pacing is terrific. As for the the actual mystery itself, I found it very clever. I was stumped and the reveal was a delight. Christie really was a genius.Kenneth Branagh is excellent in the role of Poirot once again. He's charming, funny and captivating to watch every time he's on screen. The only issue, and I understand this is not his fault, but the character has a very heavy accent which can make it quite hard to pick up the dialogue a lot of the time - and this is not a film where you want to be missing lines of dialogue.Finally, it's a great looking film it has to be said. The setting is beautiful and everything is shot in very visually appealing fashion. I had a really good time with 'Death on the Nile' and would highly recommend it, particularly if you enjoyed 'Murder on the Orient Express'. 9/10.", "language": "English", "rating": "9", "max_rating": "10", "helpful_review": "58 / 136"}

This is a terrible movie on many levels.Poirot is a different character. He is now a former war hero with a lost love and a romantic side. Unforgivably, Branagh creates a major departure involving Poirot's signature moustache. There is an obligatory nod to Poirot's obsession with order and symmetry, but overall this is not the character in the Christie novels. Why didn't Kenneth Branagh just create a new detective named Branagh rather than rewriting Poirot? Agatha Christie herself found her most popular character insufferable, but she never changed him to make him more \"normal.\"Then there is the miscasting. Gal Gadot, who is always appealing but who has neither a British nor American accent, is not even remotely believable as British heiress Lynette Ridgeway. In addition, her backstory includes an instance in which she summers in Kennebunkbort, Maine. Perhaps visiting the Bush family? So she's a New Englander too!In the novel, Ridgeway's lawyer is a childhood playmate and cousin named Pennington. In this movie, he is from India and named Katdhadorian. He's supposed to be family!? An elderly woman and her caretaker on board the ship (a spinster with her nurse in Christie's original), are in a lesbian relationship.A white character in the original novel, a British writer of terrible romance novels, is transformed into a great black blues singer, Salome Otterborne, whose daughter, Rosalie, we are told, is the irresistible love interest of a British toff. It's a good thing the script tells us this, because there is no evidence of sexual attraction or infatuation on screen. Poirot delivers a paean to here, filled with white guilt, and she replies with scorn. Both of their speeches are straight out of the woke wars of the present and have nothing to do with an Agatha Christie murder mystery.Rosalie also talks about racism she one experienced at a whites-only swimming pool in the US. So it's not just Death on the Nile. It's Death on the Mississippi Burning.Does any of this sound like Agatha Christie? Or is Branagh just using her name to get moviegoers to watch a different film? None of these problems are helped by the excessive length, slow pacing and bad CGI . A new remake should be an improvement over previous remakes, but so much of the scenery in this film is digitally created, it feels like animation.Avoid this.

The film is about a couple thieves (Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot) who are trying to steal all three treasured eggs belonging to Cleopatra....and the film also involves folks trying to stop them. So why do I say it reminds me of \"Deadpool\"? Well, Ryan Reynolds acts just like his Deadpool character...minus all the murder. He's definitely a smart-alecky guy...perhaps too much for many viewrs. And, Gadot seems much like Wonder Woman...with fighting skills that seem almost super-human. In addition, Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson is there to look cool and entertain.... I did like him in the film....the other two, well, the writing for their characters (particularly Reynolds) wasn't always great..Overall, not a bad movie and CLEARLY a film designed as the first of several more films...which I am sure we'll be seeing soon.

Comparing this with a successful example, Hobson & Shaw, yes, you need good stars, good banter, and fancy locations don't hurt. To that point, Red Notice does okay. But you also need plenty of convincing action, and a reason for the action that makes sense and that the audience cares about; and you need not to rely too much on CGI rather than real stunts and location shooting.

No one in this movie is likable. The worst is Ryan Reynolds' character, who has got to be one of the most annoying jerks ever portrayed on celluloid. Gal Gadot's Bishop is too nasty to be funny, and.

When Hartley nearly gets hold of Booth, he has a conspiracy theory known as The Bishop (Gal Gadot). For example, he can team up with Booth in trouble and seems to get out of it on his own with Booth's help, but the question is they can work together.This movie will first hit theaters, but thanks to the Corona, several movie studios have let go of buying the movie rights, eventually starting at Netflix. Thus, this has become the most expensive Netflix original film for now.Rawson Marshall Thurber has designed this film somewhat like a crime comedy, which you often saw in the 90s. The film comes across as a mix between Indiana Jones and the Ocean's Eleven movies, but with some more comedy elements. Because the movie comes across as a 90's movie, not all elements in the movie work, want to make something look outdated or unbelievable. Furthermore, the director has written the story a bit too simple and too directed. So on the one hand it comes to look at what it can be on the far-fetched side. So can come down to it, they aren't so funny anymore. The many plot twists make the story difficult to follow, or unbelievable.They have the film in several places, which can be mentioned in the film, but unfortunately the corona pandemic were unable to portray every place. That's why they brought out these scenes in the movie studio and with a green screen the backgrounds of these places. That these moments are not really local on screen, unfortunately they are on when you can see them again. Some random shots are via FPV drone. This is the first film in which this way of filming is used.The acting is well done by the film cast. The three major stars portray their roles well, but do this a lot in their familiar way. They seem a bit standard in this film compared to their roles in other films. Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds play nice together. Yet they come across more as people who are obliged to work together. The film tries to portray them as people who start to care more and more about each other during their collaboration, but they do not really achieve this status in the film and continue to come across as a duo that is forced to work together. Gal Gadot also does well in the film, but comes out more in the middle of the film, to do something with her role.", "language": "English", "rating": "4", "max_rating": "10", "helpful_review": "6 / 7"}

Having seen a number of superb Agatha Christie stories such as Black Coffee on stage, I got set for a trip on the Nile..View on the film:.Shot on 65MM film, lead actor/ director Kenneth Branagh & his regular cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos use the format to give the immaculate costumes and Tiffany & Co designed jewelry worn by the suspects a shine, (with Poirot looking dapper for the entire voyage) and a smoky grain to the Jazz clubs where Salome sings..Made before, but coming out after Belfast (2021-also reviewed), Branagh makes a terrific experiment of black and white with colour contrast, as flashbacks have lone objects dipped in bright colours, highlighting the main clues on the ship..Taking place on a cruise ship or the vast majority of the run time, Branagh uncoils the mystery with a refine, glossy atmosphere of excellent extended tracking shots running down the corridors of the ship as the murder is in motion, landing on stylish arc shots and close-ups, as Poirot narrows his gaze on the lead suspects..Finding their time on the cruise ship to be ruined by a spot of murder, the ensemble cast bring a star-studded glamour to proceedings, with Gal Gadot & Emma Mackey hissing at each other like vipers as Linnet and Jackie, Sophie Okonedo hitting the high-notes as Salome, whose warmth from Okonedo gets Poirot to (somewhat) drop his guard, Kenneth Branagh captures Poirot's mind working like clockwork in piecing the clues together, and Armie Hammer chews, the scenery as Simon..Previously having dug into a character study of Wolverine with Logan (2017-also reviewed), the screenplay by Michael Green attempts to explore the background to Poirot's drive to solving cases with flashbacks, which whilst offering a unique origin to his mustache (!) does trim away at the tension from the mystery..Making a composite of some of the characters in order to make the cast list more small-scale, Green's adaptation highlights how Agatha Christie's twist still has a scorpion sting, as Poirot puts under his magnifying glass all of venom that the guests are entangled in,as a death occurs on the Nile.", "language": "English", "rating": "7", "max_rating": "10", "helpful_review": "13 / 42"}

{"url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7873980/", "title": "Death on the Nile", "review_header": "A Timeless Story That Has Stood the Test of Time", "review_content": "Death on the Nile is a thriller based upon the famous novel by Agatha Christie that has already been adapted into numerous video games, television series, radio shows, movies and comic books. This film follows Murder on the Orient Express, written and directed by the same team five years ago. This movie brings the first half of the twentieth century to life in a nostalgic way and tells a fascinating story in great depth and detail.The story revolves around Belgian war veteran and detective Hercule Poirot who encounters his friend Bouc while vacationing in Egypt. Bouc introduces him to his friends Linnet and Simon who have recently gotten married and are celebrating their honeymoon. They decide to hire the famous detective to protect them from Jackie, who was once in a relationship with Simon and friends with Linnet and is consumed with jealousy. Things indeed take a sinister turn on the cruise ship and Hercule Poirot needs to put the different pieces of the puzzle together to come to a stunning conclusion.This film convinces on several levels. First of all, the settings are truly lush and should be enjoyed on the big screen. This starts with the extravagant clothing, continues with beautiful make-up and concludes with authentic objects from the thirties and stunning locations in a beautiful country.Up next, the acting performances are overall quite decent. Kenneth Branagh convinces as cunning, curious and dynamic detective with a lonesome lifestyle and saddening past. Emma Mackey shines as aggressive, sensible and sinister antagonist who haunts everybody on the cruise ship. Armie Hammer delivers the goods as good-looking but shady husband who is playing a very dangerous game.The highlight of the movie remains the fascinating story line. Once the first crime takes place, the viewers will follow a dramatic sequence of events that will keep them putting the pieces together until the very end. The story has aged rather well and is exceptionally brilliant. If you are not familiar with the novel or earlier adaptations of it, this movie will leave a lasting impression and might deserve multiple viewings to fully grasp all the details of the numerous crimes that have been going on.A special shoutout goes to the movie's imaginative opening and closing. The former shows a clever young Hercules Poirot who manages to save his fellow soldiers during the horrors of the First World War but is unable to protect his captain and himself. The latter shows how the aging detective is slowly putting a term to his lonesome lifestyle and opens up to let his heart rule his mind again.The movie obviously also has some minor flaws. The first half is unnecessarily long as it takes half of the film before any significant dramatic events occur. Up next, the acting performances aren't as universally convincing as in the famous adaptation of the seventies with acting legends such as Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, Angela Lansbury, David Niven and Peter Ustinov.However, Death on the Nile is a timeless thriller that still convinces in its most recent adaptation with outstanding settings, excellent plot, great acting performances and a few creative twists in the opening and closing sequences. Fans of the novel and its numerous adaptations should certainly appreciate this film. Anyone who likes clever whodunits should give this marvelous movie a chance.", "language": "English", "rating": "8", "max_rating": "10", "helpful_review": "14 / 39"}

Too much of the film's runtime is spent watching rich people gallivant and enjoy their wealth, whilst repeatedly mentioning their own wealth. The characters, bar Poirot, are largely dislikable and once the death finally comes it enters the film as welcome relief from a dull and irritating foundation. Many of the characters that are later accused of murder are fairly skimmed over too, focus lying on the main trio, creating small and insignificant arcs for the rest later on.Once the murder has taken place, and Poirot finally has the opportunity to be Poirot, things get rapidly more interesting. Whilst the finale can be claimed to be the most obvious option by many, the lead up to the reveal does provide interest across the characters, and the investigation feels swift as it is enjoyable (and simple) to follow.Unfortunately, it's all too clear that many of the settings are green-screen, so something that should be visually stunning is a little dissatisfying. Acting is acceptable on the whole, in fact it is actually Gadot and Hammer - two of the highest billed - who feel a little unsatisfactory, but that could be due to the characters being insufferable. Surprisingly, the (somewhat brief) appearances made by the comedy duo French & Saunders, plus Brand are impressive and fit well into the storyline.

{"url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7848695/", "title": "Death on the Nile", "review_header": "Murders Most Melodramatic", "review_content": "Jacqueline de Bellefort introduced her handsome but penniless fiance Simon Boyle to her wealthy friend Linnet Ridgeway. However, it would turn out later that Simon dumped Jackie and had married Linnet instead. So when the newly-married couple went on a grand honeymoon in Egypt, the rejected Jackie stalked them the whole way, even booking herself on a cruise of the Nile on the river boat Karnak, on which the Doyles were also booked.One night, there was a murder onboard the boat, someone had been shot at close range on the forehead. When famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot began to investigate, every other passenger on the cruise with them seemed to have a reason to kill the victim, who it turned out was not exactly the congenial type. A couple more murders were still to be committed before Poirot was able to finally piece together the complex plot.In the original 1978 film version of \"Death on the Nile\" directed by John Guillermin, Peter Ustinov played the inimitable Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, taking over from Albert Finney who played Poirot in \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1974). Just like first film, the murder had been committed in a confined location (this time a river boat). It also had an impressive array of actors playing the suspects for the murder of Linnet Ridgeway (Lois Chiles).The all-star cast included Bette Davis (as the grand dame Marie Van Schuyler), Maggie Smith (her stern nurse Ms. Bower), Angela Lansbury (flighty romance author Salome Otterbourne), Olivia Hussey (her anxious daughter Rosalie), Jack Warden (the defensive Dr. Bessler), George Kennedy (the unscrupulous Atty. Andrew Pendleton), Jane Birkin (Linnet's maid Louise), Mia Farrow (Jackie), and Simon MacCorkindale (Simon).In this new film remake, Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) was investigating the case of Linnet Ridgeway (Gal Gadot). Simon (Armie Hammer) was her husband, Jackie (Emma Mackey) her friend, and Louise (Rose Leslie) her maid. Some characters had the same names but different relationships. Marie Van Schuyler (Jennifer Saunders) was now Linnet's godmother, with Ms. Bowers (Dawn French) her nurse. Salome Otterbourne (Sophie Okenedo) was now a blues singer, while her niece Rosalie (Letitia Wright) was Linnet's close friend.There were also characters whose names and relationships with Linnet were changed. The lawyer character is now Linnet's cousin Andrew Katchadourian (Ali Faizal). The doctor character is now Linnet's ex-fiance Linus Windlesham (Russell Brand). Instead of David Niven's Col. Race, the role of Poirot's friend went to Bouc (Tom Bateman), who was also in the previous case on the Orient Express. Bouc brought his artist mother Euphemia (Annette Bening) along, and was in a romantic relationship with Rosalie.Gal Gadot fit the bill of the glamourous heiress to a T. However, she did not project Linnet's haughtiness that well, unlike how Lois Chiles did it. Emma Mackey (whom I never knew before this film) had a more challenging role as Jackie. However, she looked quite strong and confident, unlike how Mia Farrow gave her Jackie a weak, clingy, needy vibe the character needed. Armie Hammer's screen presence seems diminishing with his every film, even in a big role as Simon. Tom Bateman even upstaged him in more minor role as Bouc.Aside from a prologue (why Poirot grew his fancy mustache) and an epilogue (how Poirot may be falling in love again), the basic plot of the novel remained the same with significant alterations to promote present-day concerns like multi-racial and LGBTQ representations. The production design was rich with 1930s aristocratic glamor and exotic Egyptian antiquities. With a much darker color palette and serious mood, Branagh's approach tended to be quite melodramatic, especially at the climax, without the campy humor of the original.", "language": "English", "rating": "7", "max_rating": "10", "helpful_review": "20 / 54"}

{"url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8117863/", "title": "Death on the Nile", "review_header": "An anti-vaxxer, a conspiracy theorist and a cannibal walk into a cruise ship...", "review_content": "How did Poirot get his moustache? If the answer isn't that his moustache is actually an alien that crash-landed on Earth, crawled its way onto his upper lip and entered into a symbiotic relationship with him that granted him the brainpower needed to become the 'greatest detective in the world' (which, spoiler alert, it isn't), then that answer doesn't need to be seen on the big screen. Yet, 'Death On The Nile (2022)' opts to open with a black-and-white pre-title sequence (ala 'Casino Royale (2006)') that gives Poirot's lip-warmer a tragic backstory to imbue it with thematic resonance.If it weren't done so earnestly, it could easily be considered a joke, or a slice of scathing satire aimed at studios who opt to adorn their flagship franchises with unnecessary prequels and spin-offs based wholly on superficial elements of the mainline entries. There isn't a shred of irony to be found here, though. Instead, we get a serious (yet seriously unsuccessful) attempt at getting the audience to cry in the opening moments and a sequence which does nothing other than confuse those expecting to see an adaptation of Agatha Christie's source novel (some members of my family genuinely thought I had put the wrong film on).When things shift into colour, you may expect the picture to get significantly better. However, the flick once again subverts your expectation in the worst way possible. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that, eventually, there is a death on the Nile, but it takes absolutely ages before that actually happens (literally over an hour). That isn't an inherently bad thing; a murder-mystery could use a long set-up to carefully put its dominoes into place while getting us to care about its characters, something which would make the inevitable killing all the more impactful. This doesn't do that, though. For a very long time, the picture isn't so much a whodunit as a whocares.The flick banally introduces its characters one at a time without building a shred of suspense, all while it treats us to some seriously wonky CGI vistas (a couple of shots brought 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)' to mind) and occasionally gives us a glimpse of the OCD Poirot is apparently famous for. Though the affair admirably attempts to make his involvement in the case more personal, the heroic detective just isn't a compelling protagonist. He's undercooked, present only to ponder false leads and eventually deliver the mystery's ultimate solution. The surrounding story just isn't strong enough to justify a placeholder protagonist (unlike in, say, a 'James Bond' or 'Mission: Impossible' movie). This is likely a failing of the source novel (or, rather, something that prevents it from translating well to film), as is the fact that the climax amounts to little more than someone telling everyone else (and us) the plot. Still, an adaptation isn't bound by the shortcomings of its inspiration, even though faithfulness is something most fans seem to covet. Therefore, I think it's fair to criticise the picture for its translation issues.In terms of narrative, the picture is a mixed bag. Its central conundrum just isn't wrinkled enough, despite the movie's efforts to switch things up as it approaches its finale. There is the occasionally unexpected moment, but mostly it plays out kind of how you'd expect it to. Perhaps a bigger issue is the fact that the film doesn't actively inspire you to engage with its enigma. There came a point where I remember thinking \"I'll take a guess and say that this person is the killer, but I won't get any sort of satisfaction if I'm right and I genuinely don't care if I'm wrong.\" The flick is the sort of thing that just washes over you, never truly engaging even when it's at its most entertaining. Plus, its eventual reveal is handled so matter-of-factly that it doesn't even register as shocking (though that's perhaps because it isn't actually shocking at all) and it inspires nothing more than a meek \"oh... okay.\"I know it sounds like I hate the picture, but I don't. Once the eponymous death on the Nile finally occurs, it kicks into gear and gets a lot more enjoyable. Though it isn't intellectually or emotionally stimulating, it's fun enough for what it is. The movie elects to reduce its cast and connect all of its characters to the victim, crafting a web of interpersonal relationships that simply isn't present in the book (which I haven't read, by the way). This is a good choice that makes the story feel more purposeful and personal than it otherwise would have. The piece also decides to bring back a character from 'Murder On The Orient Express (2017)', which gives Poirot a likeable on-screen friendship and a more compelling reason to be on board.The cast is relatively strong, although some members certainly do better than others. They all turn in admirable performances and do the best with what they're given, but most of them just aren't given enough. The elephant on the boat is, of course, Armie Hammer, whose involvement in the affair is responsible for its most recent delay. One of the biggest sins the film commits is making us watch the guy dry hump someone for what seems like five minutes, and this happens more than once. I mean, come on, Ken, really? Other iffy performers include anti-vaxxer Letitia Wright and conspiracy theorist Russell Brand, but neither of them make you feel anywhere near as gross as Armie 'humping' Hammer. Plus, they perform just as well as most of their counterparts.In front of the camera, Kenneth Branagh chews on his accent amicably enough, doing what he needs to with a fair bit of gravitas. Behind it, however, his direction just feels a bit flat. He just never does anything unexpected. It's incredibly obvious that the flick was shot on sets surrounded by nothing other than green or blue, and there isn't much atmosphere to be found. The cinematography doesn't help, either. Everything is just a bit too clean, resulting in a glossy adventure that doesn't even manage to make its deaths seem upsetting (the actors still look glamourous even when they're supposed to be corpses, adorned with neat little bullet wounds or daintily slashed throats).Again, I don't want to rag on the thing too much. It's decently enjoyable once it gets going, the kind of funhouse fluff that would be right at home on ITV. It's a forgettable yet sort of affable affair, one that doesn't really require your full attention. If you can get past its first hour, there are more than a couple of things to like about it. It's fine.", "language": "English", "rating": "6", "max_rating": "10", "helpful_review": "4 / 7"}

Kenneth Branagh does great with the role. The newcomers like Annette Being, Russell Brand, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Letitia Wright and many others are all talented.The script drags the story. The direction is slow and boring. Every clue is revealed slowly, and when the twist is revealed. It is no surprise or giving you that thrill. I found the film to be boring and slow.

I have investigated many crimes, but this has altered the shape of my soul. I am detective Hercule Poirot, and I will deliver your killer.\" Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh)In the newest Agatha Christie/Hercule Poirot mystery, Death on the Nile, Poirot is about as serious as mystery fiction would allow, and certainly the obsessive Poirot would allow. Because one of the murder victims means much to him, and because he is smitten by jazz singer Salome (Sophie Okonedo), Poirot is a full-bodied detective sharing some of our humanity and bringing a sympathy without witty accusations.The location in an elegant paddle boat on the Nile and remarkable gigantic effigies of Ramses and the Sphinx lends a historicity to the proceedings while the icons tie vacationers to our sometimes-wicked natures. The new Queen of the Nile, Linette (Gal Godot), is grandly wealthy, gorgeous, and like the rest of us, vulnerable. Her new husband, Simon (Armie Hammer), is attentive but does not match her wealth, yet matches her gorgeous looks.The rest of the cast is appropriately good looking and fit for suspicion, each with his/her reason to off the new bride. They may be the least intricate and magical of the suspects in this sub-genre, if only because Christie, director Branagh, and writer Michel Green are careful not to give much away while they develop characters real and weak, rightfully suspect as we all might be in similar circumstances.The operative motif is love-mainly what we do for it, sometimes murder. This notion of potential mayhem in the wake of passion is well-chosen, for without its heat the mystery is just a lazy day down the river. It's not that but rather is a treatise on the conjunction of love and sin, real or metaphorical. What we do for love, how we live without it, even Poirot, is the subject of Death on the Nile, gently woven into a seemingly light murder mystery. It is after all about \"death.\"\"The romance of the desert has the power to seduce. I ask you: have you ever loved so much, been so possessed by jealousy, that you might kill?\" Poirot.", "language": "English", "rating": null, "max_rating": "", "helpful_review": "20 / 45"}
